# Welcome to DEEP-DYNAMAX!

This is [Dynamax](https://github.com/probml/dynamax) but with Deep Hidden Markov Models being implemented, following works in 
Deep parameterizations of pairwise and triplet Markov models for unsupervised classification of sequential data, Hugo Gangloff, Katherine Morales, Yohan Petetin [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947322002432)

First results should be presented sooon
